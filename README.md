# Bioinformatics analytics

# Description:
This is a miniature dataset that was simulated based on individual research and doesnt relate or correspond to any organization. This dataset would be fun play around with especially for folks from a Biotechology or Bioinformatics background. 


# Information about the features of this dataset :

The variables represent a broad range of data commonly used in plant biotechnology research, including genetic and molecular information, gene expression profiles, protein properties, genetic variation, trait associations. To the best of my knowledge I have modified them but feel free to your inputs. 

The following is a brief introduction to what the variables actually are.

# Gene Sequence Data:
Gene ID: Unique identifier for each gene sequence.
Gene Sequence: DNA or RNA sequence of the gene.
Gene Description: Brief description or annotation of the gene.

# Expression Data:
Tissue Type: Type of tissue where gene expression was measured (e.g., leaf, root, stem).
Experimental Condition: Experimental condition under which gene expression was measured (e.g., drought stress, high light intensity).
Expression Level: Quantitative measure of gene expression, such as transcript abundance or signal intensity.

# Protein Data:
Protein ID: Unique identifier for each protein.
Protein Sequence: Amino acid sequence of the protein.
Protein Function: Functional description or annotation of the protein.

# SNP Data (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism):
SNP ID: Unique identifier for each SNP.
Chromosome: Chromosome location of the SNP.
Position: Genomic position of the SNP on the chromosome.
Alleles: Different alleles present at the SNP locus.
Genotype: Genotype information for each individual (e.g., AA, AB, BB).

# Genetic Mapping Data:
QTL ID: Unique identifier for each quantitative trait locus (QTL).
Chromosome: Chromosome location of the QTL.
Position: Genomic position of the QTL on the chromosome.
Trait: Phenotypic trait associated with the QTL (e.g., yield, height).
LOD Score: Logarithm of the odds (LOD) score, indicating the strength of the association between the QTL and the trait.

 I would advice anyone who tries to look at this dataset to do more of their research on each of the above attributes so that the final interpretations would be relevant and understandable.

But otherwise, Have fun!!
